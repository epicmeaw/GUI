        League is a team base game where the objective of the game is the
        destroy the enemy inhibitor. There are many objectives on the map for
        you to take advantage of when you are fighting your opponents.

        These are some of the few Champions that I have played. Lux is a support
        who can slow down the enemy and root them in place, and her ult can do a
        tremendous amount of damage. While Pyke is more movement with an ability
        to hook the enemy to oneself and a dash that will stun the opponents. My
        favorite ability is his ult which is an execute that kills the enemy
        when they reach a certain amount of health and grants gold to your
        teammate and oneself.

        We have the top, mid, and bot lanes on the map. The jungle is also
        filled with creatures to kill for exp. I like to play as the support who
        is in bot lane or the jungle. They are position which is crucial in
        determining your team's success. This is because they are not the damage
        dealer but the roles that create an opportunity to engage with the
        opponents.
